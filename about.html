    <p>
      Hello, My name is Torra Tran. Currently 21 years old and going to school
      for web development at Fullstack Academy. I have been working at amazon
      for over a year now, and just recently I've decided to get into web
      development, which kick-started my journey into Fullstack Academy. I find
      web development interesting and at the same time and compliated, but I'll
      slowly understand it. Wish me luck!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before working at amazon, I had three different jobs and learning all
      differnt kinds of skills.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Washington State Fair (Puyallup Fair)</li>
      <li>Jamba Juice</li>
      <li>Club Demonstration Services</li>
    </ol>
    <div style="font-size: 20px" class="container">
      My first job was when I had graduated highschool, It was summertime and I
      happened to be free doing nothing but staying in the house all day. My
      cousin had decided to get a job at the puyallup fair and invited my
      brother and and I, as well as my other cousin. We all ended up applying
      there and working there all together until the fair was over. It was hot
      and crowded with people everywhere, but I had an enjoyble time interacting
      with new people I met there.

      My second job was at Jamba Juice. I had just graduated from a two-year
      college with an associates degree and was looking for another job yet
      again, then I found out that Jamba Juice was hiring so I applied. I had
      been curious what it would be like working in a cafe, as I had tried
      applying at starbucks a few times, but never heard back from then, so I
      decided to give it a chance here. It was nice and all but since I wasn't a
      fast worker and working at my own pace, so I found out that this job
      wasn't suited that well for me, so I left to find yet another job.

      My third job was the Club Demonstration Services or CDS for short. It was
      more of a coincidence since I happend to be shopping in costco, when I saw
      the sign saying that they were hiring people with no experience needed.
      Seeing that there was no experience needed i decided to try it out. It
      turned out to be a sales advisor job with me demonstrating how the product
      can be used as well as the nutrition facts and knowing all about the
      product and encourging people and come and see. As well as to try it out
      if I happened to be doing food that day. I got to try plenty of samples
      from both my booth as well as my co-workers booth. It was delicious food.

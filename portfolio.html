        <p>
          This is about a mini-zoo webpage that has 5 different types of animals
          with either 2 or 3 names for each including a description of the
          animal, a link as well as a photo of the animal.

        <h3 style="font-size: 30px">Grocery List</h3>
        <p>
          This website shows what you need to shop for in both pantry and
          freezer food in an ordered list and unordered list along with a photo.
          We ended up using a box model to seperate them from each other.

          This is about me learning how to make shapes and as well as making a
          form so people who are intersted may submit their name and email
          address. When they hit sumbit it will take you to another page and
          give you a message.

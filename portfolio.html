      <li>Zoo Animals</li>
      <li>Grocery List</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 style="font-size: 30px">Zoo Animals</h2>
    <p>
      This is about a mini-zoo webpage that has 5 different types of animals
      with either 2 or 3 names for each including a description of the animal, a
      link as well as a photo of the animal.

    <h3 style="font-size: 30px">Grocery List</h3>
    <p>
      This website shows what you need to shop for in both pantry and freezer
      food in an ordered list and unordered list along with a photo. We ended up
      using a box model to seperate them from each other.
